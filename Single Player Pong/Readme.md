Game's description: This game is a simpler version of the classic Atari's Pong Game. In this game, we have only one paddle and the ball. The player has to hit the ball in order to make it bounces off the side and top walls. If the ball reaches the bottom line, the round is over. The player has 3 chances. In the last time the ball hits the ground, the game is over and this message appears on the screen. To start any round, the player has to press the spacebar key. This instruction is given in the terminal, under the game screen.
